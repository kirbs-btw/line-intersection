# Intersection of two lines python 
calculates the intersection of two lines - found no good lib or nice code for that 
3d lines 

returnes none for every value thats not a point like lines that a paralell return none

# how to use ? 
- other lib.. will be included
create two line obj 
complex or normal line

an let those intersect with the intersection() function
its pretty hardcoded and not loopy just cecking for the possible variable existance and doint basic math.
